# Week 1
*March 10 - March 16, 2025*

## Monday, March 10, 2025
- Continued with solving problems using the sliding window technique
- Solved the Maximun Average Subarray problem: this problem is about finding the subarray of a given length k that has the maximum average value
- Solved the Max Consecutive Ones III problem: this problem is ab out finding the longest subarray with at most k zeros

## Tuesday, March 11, 2025
- Learned about prefix sum and how it can be used to solve problems
- Solved Running Sum of 1d Array problem: this problem is about finding the running sum of an array

## Wednesday, March 12, 2025
- Solved Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum problem: this problem is about finding the minimum value that can be added to an array of integers to make the sum of the array positive
- Solved K Radius Subarrays Averages: this problem is about finding the average of all subarrays of length k in an array. I used the prefix sum technique over the sliding window technique to solve this problem

## Notes:
```cpp
// iterate over the vector
for (int num: nums) {
  cout << num << endl;
}

// create a vector of size n and initialize all elements to -1
vector<int> averages(n, -1); 


```
