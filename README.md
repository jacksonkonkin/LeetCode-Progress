# LeetCode-Progress
This repo is used to track my LeetCode progress

I have dedicated my Sunday to Thursday evenings from 7:30pm to 9:30pm as a time slot to work on personal projects/learnings

My first project is my LeetCode journey

I will spend my 2 hours on LeetCode problems/courses 5 days a week until my birthday, April 30th, 2025

From there I will continue to solve leetcode problems but at a much reduced rate that is yet to be determined. Most likely 2-3 problems a week to keep my skills sharp

After my birthday, I will start to work on other projects that I have in mind, the first most likely being my own personal portfolio website
